1.	How do lists and tuples differ in terms of mutability and performance? When would you choose one over the other?

Ans:-   Lists and tuples are both used to store multiple items in Python, but they have key differences:

Mutability:

Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after creating them.
Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed.
Performance:

Tuples are faster than lists because they use less memory and have a fixed size.
Lists are slower because they allow modifications and take up more memory.

When to Use What?

Use a list when you need to modify data (e.g., adding/removing elements).
Use a tuple when data should remain constant (e.g., fixed configurations, coordinates).


2. Explain how Python handles type conversion between different data types, such as between integers and floats or between strings and lists. 

python handle types of conversion in two ways:
 1 implicit conversion(automatic)

python automatically convert smaller data type to larger ones when needed

ex:-  num = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5

 2 explicit conversion(manual/type casting)
You can manually convert data types using functions 

# String to int
num = int("10")  # Output: 10 

3  Take a number and use the += operator to increase its value by 10.  in easy language

num = 5   
num += 10
print(num) 
# Output: 15

4 Write a Python program to check if a given year is a leap year or not.   


year = int(input("Enter a year: ")) 

# Check leap year conditions
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) :
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")


5.	Write a program that asks the user to enter their marks and displays their grade: • 90-100: A 
•	80-89: B 
•	70-79: C 
•	60-69: D 
•	Below 60: F 

marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))  # Take marks as input

# Check grade based on marks
if 90 <= marks <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif 80 <= marks <= 89:
    print("Grade: B")
elif 70 <= marks <= 79:
    print("Grade: C")
elif 60 <= marks <= 69:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
